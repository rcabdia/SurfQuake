To add Google Analytics to your GitHub Pages website, follow these steps:

Sign in to your Google Analytics account or create a new one at https://analytics.google.com/.
Once signed in, click on the "Admin" tab at the bottom left corner of the page.
In the "Property" column, click on the drop-down menu and select the website you want to add Google Analytics to.
Under the "Property" column, click on "Tracking Info" and then "Tracking Code".
In the "Tracking Code" section, you will see a block of JavaScript code. Copy this code.
Now, let's add the Google Analytics tracking code to your GitHub Pages website:

Go to your GitHub repository where your GitHub Pages website is hosted.
In the repository, navigate to the folder where your website's HTML files are located.
Open the HTML file(s) where you want to add Google Analytics (e.g., index.html).
Paste the Google Analytics tracking code just before the closing </head> tag.
Here's an example of how the code should look in your HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Your other HTML code here -->
  
  <!-- Paste the Google Analytics tracking code here -->
  <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_TRACKING_ID"></script>
  <script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
  
    gtag('config', 'YOUR_TRACKING_ID');
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your HTML body content here -->
</body>
</html>
Replace YOUR_TRACKING_ID in the code with the Tracking ID provided in your Google Analytics account (e.g., UA-XXXXXXXXX-X).

Save the changes to your HTML file(s) and commit them to your GitHub repository.
Wait for a few hours, and then visit your website. Google Analytics should start tracking your website's traffic and provide data in your Google Analytics account.
Note: If you are using a static site generator like Jekyll, you may need to add the Google Analytics tracking code to a specific file or configuration file according to your site's setup. Refer to the documentation of your static site generator for more details.
